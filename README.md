# Tour of Heroes

The Tour of Heroes is an Angular application that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.

I created it with a tutorial for Angular learning.

The finished application:

- Gets a list of heroes
- Displays the heroes in a list
- Has a hero search
- Edits a selected hero's details
- Creates new heroes, updates and deletes existing ones
- Navigates between different views of heroic data
